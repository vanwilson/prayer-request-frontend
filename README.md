# Prayer Request App

This multipage app allows users to share prayer requests. As I searched for a quality mobile app for prayer, I realized that none of the apps were simplified enough for the lay church member to share prayer requests directly with their church family. I created a frontend using React and styled with Bootstrap.

Users can sign up for an account, log in, and view all prayer requests in the community filtering different prayer types.
Users can create and edit their prayer requests.

Technologies include React, Bootstrap, and react-router-dom.

## Installation
